# Clicking-Game
Hey there! This is a simple clicking game I made with JavaScript. The goal is to click on the target as many times as possible before the time runs out. The game has three difficulty levels - easy, medium, and hard. The target size changes based on the difficulty level you choose.

I also added a scoreboard that shows your score and remaining lives. You have three lives, and you lose one each time you miss the target. If you lose all your lives, the game is over.

To play the game, just click on the target when it appears on the canvas. The game will start as soon as you select a difficulty level.

# Installation
